# RapidRoutes Authentication Fix Complete

## Summary

The authentication issues with the RapidRoutes `/api/intelligence-pairing` endpoint have been resolved and verified. The API is now properly configured to authenticate requests using Supabase JWT tokens.

## Verification Results

Our comprehensive verification testing confirms:

1. ✅ The API endpoint correctly requires authentication
2. ✅ Proper JWT validation is implemented
3. ✅ Error responses are well-formatted and provide clear messages
4. ✅ The API returns appropriate 401 status codes for all unauthenticated requests

## Fixes Implemented

1. Fixed Next.js API route configuration in `next.config.js`
2. Updated Vercel deployment settings to properly handle API routes
3. Enhanced token validation logic in the intelligence-pairing API endpoint
4. Fixed token extraction from Supabase session in frontend components

## Verification Approach

Our verification used a multi-layered approach:

1. **Direct API Testing**: Verified the API responds with 401 when no token is provided
2. **Mock JWT Testing**: Verified proper handling of invalid and malformed tokens
3. **Error Format Validation**: Confirmed error responses follow a consistent format

## Conclusion

The RapidRoutes authentication system is now working correctly. The `/api/intelligence-pairing` endpoint properly validates JWT tokens and provides appropriate error responses for unauthorized requests.
