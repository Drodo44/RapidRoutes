# Partial Destination Validation Update

## Changes Implemented

The validation logic in `pages/post-options.js` has been updated to allow lanes with partial destination information (either city or state) to proceed with batch pairing:

1. **Previous Behavior**:
   - Required both `destination_city` AND `destination_state` to be present
   - Rejected lanes that had only one of these fields
   - Displayed generic error messages without lane-specific details

2. **New Behavior**:
   - Requires at least one of `destination_city` OR `destination_state` to be present
   - Allows processing to continue with partial destination data
   - Provides detailed console.error messages with lane-specific information
   - Improves user feedback with clearer error messages

## Implementation Details

### Single Lane Validation Logic

```javascript
// Allow lanes with either destination_city OR destination_state
const destinationCity = lane.destination_city || lane.destinationCity;
const destinationState = lane.destination_state || lane.destinationState;
const hasDestinationData = destinationCity || destinationState;

// Require hasDestinationData instead of both fields separately
```

### Batch Processing Logic

```javascript
// Allow partial destination data (either city or state is acceptable)
const hasDestinationData = destinationCity || destinationState;
const missing = !originCity || !originState || !hasDestinationData || !equipmentCode;
```

### Error Reporting Improvements

- Added detailed console.error messages that include:
  - Lane ID
  - Full details of all fields
  - Clear indication of which fields are missing
- Improved user-facing error messages to be more instructive

## Verification

1. **Build Status**: ✅ Successfully built with no errors
2. **Deployment Status**: ✅ Pushed to main branch, awaiting Vercel deployment
3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Lanes with partial destination information will now proceed through pairing
   - Detailed error messages in console for easier debugging
   - Batch processing will be more resilient to partial data

## Next Steps

- Monitor Vercel deployment to ensure changes take effect in production
- Test the `/post-options` page with lanes containing partial destination information
- Verify that batch pairing processes these lanes successfully
