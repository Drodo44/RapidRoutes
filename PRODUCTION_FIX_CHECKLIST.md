### Verification Commands Run
```bash
# Build verification
âœ… npm run build

# Server verification
âœ… npm run start

# API verification
âœ… curl -H "x-rapidroutes-test: TOKEN" "http://localhost:3000/api/lanes?limit=5"

# Import verification
âœ… grep -r "from.*services/laneService'" --count = 0 (all fixed)

# Git status
âœ… git log -2 --oneline
```

### Sample API Response
```json
{
  "id": "36545334",
  "reference_id": "36545334",
  "origin_city": "Bradenton",
  "origin_state": "FL",
  "destination_city": "NORFOLK",
  "destination_state": "NE",
  "equipment_code": "R",
  "origin_kma_code": "Lakeland Mkt",
  "destination_kma_code": "Omaha Mkt",
  "origin_zip3": null,
  "destination_zip3": null
}
```

### What Was Fixed
**Problem:** API returned null values for all fields despite successful queries
**Root Cause:** TypeScript compilation breaking Supabase client
**Solution:** Converted laneService to JavaScript
