# Phase 5: Production Lockdown & Deployment Hardening

This document summarizes the production hardening measures implemented in Phase 5 of the RapidRoutes project to ensure stable, secure, and optimized deployment.

## 1. Environment Configuration

- ✅ `.env.production` file updated with production-specific variables
- ✅ Environment validation in place for critical variables
- ✅ Fallbacks implemented for non-critical environment variables

## 2. Bundle Optimization

- ✅ Added `@next/bundle-analyzer` for monitoring bundle sizes
- ✅ Set `"sideEffects": false` in package.json for better tree-shaking
- ✅ Configured webpack resolution with proper extensions
- ✅ Added npm scripts for analyzing bundle sizes

## 3. Error Handling & Resilience

- ✅ Enhanced `ErrorBoundary` component with:
  - Production-specific error UI (user-friendly)
  - Development-specific detailed error UI (developer-friendly)
  - Specific React Error #130 detection and reporting
  - Global application wrapping in `_app.js`
  - Per-page component wrapping for isolated errors
- ✅ Added health check endpoint (`/api/healthcheck`) for monitoring

## 4. Security Enhancements

- ✅ Auth middleware (`withAuth`) added for securing API routes
  - Token validation
  - Role-based access control
  - Unauthorized/forbidden responses
- ✅ Applied auth middleware to sensitive endpoints
- ✅ Removed backup directories and files
- ✅ Enhanced image optimization security settings

## 5. Deployment Safeguards

- ✅ Created pre-deployment verification script
  - Environment variable validation
  - Critical file presence check
  - ESLint verification
  - Build testing
  - Bundle size analysis

## 6. Image Optimization

- ✅ Added AVIF format support
- ✅ Configured responsive sizes for different devices
- ✅ Set cache TTL for improved performance
- ✅ Disabled SVG (security enhancement)
- ✅ Added strict Content Security Policy for images

## Next Steps

1. Run pre-deployment verification script before each production deployment
2. Monitor health check endpoint regularly
3. Configure external monitoring for the health check endpoint
4. Consider implementing automated smoke tests post-deployment
5. Set up error logging service integration in production

## Verification

These changes have been carefully tested locally to ensure they don't break existing functionality while enhancing the production readiness of the application.
