### 4. Dark Mode - Now Premium Quality!

**Dashboard Stat Cards**:
```

┌────────────────────┐
│ Pending Lanes      │
│ 100                │ ← Hard to read
└────────────────────┘

AFTER (vibrant):
╔════════════════════╗  ← 2px border
║ PENDING LANES      ║  ← Uppercase label
║ 100                ║  ← 32px bold value
╚════════════════════╝  ← Shadow for depth
```

**Colors**:
- Backgrounds: Deeper black (#0a0f1a)
- Text: Crisper white (#f8fafc)
- Borders: More visible (#374151)
- Accents: Brighter blues/greens
- Shadows: Pronounced depth

### 5. Light Mode - Still Perfect!

No changes needed - light mode was already optimal.
All improvements are dark mode specific.
