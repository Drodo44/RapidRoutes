# React Error #130 Fix: Complete Solution

## Issue Summary

The `/post-options` page was failing with React Error #130: "Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined."

## Root Cause

The page was attempting to render a `<FixedHeader />` component but was importing `Header` from '../components/Header'. This mismatch between the imported component and the rendered component name was causing React to encounter `undefined` when trying to render `FixedHeader`.

## Fix Implemented

1. Modified `/pages/post-options.js` to correctly use the `<Header />` component in the JSX:

   ```jsx
   <ErrorBoundary componentName="Header">
     <Header />
   </ErrorBoundary>
   ```
   
   Instead of:

   ```jsx
   <ErrorBoundary componentName="FixedHeader">
     <FixedHeader />
   </ErrorBoundary>
   ```

2. The Header component itself was already correctly implemented and exported as a default export in `/components/Header.js`.

## Verification

1. Build process completed successfully with no errors related to this component.
2. The `/post-options` page now renders correctly, showing the Header component at the top.
3. City data display and checkbox functionality now work as expected.

## Lessons Learned

1. Always ensure component names in JSX match the imported component names.
2. Error boundaries are extremely helpful for isolating and diagnosing React rendering errors.
3. React Error #130 often occurs when trying to render an undefined component, which usually means there's a mismatch between imports and usage.

## Future Recommendations

1. Add ESLint rules to catch undefined component usage.
2. Consider using TypeScript to help prevent these kinds of errors at compile time.
3. Maintain consistent component naming across the codebase.
