# RR# Format Clarification Needed + Heat Map Fix

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ‚è≥ AWAITING USER INPUT

## üî¢ RR# Format Question

### Current Implementation:
- **Format**: `RR#####` (e.g., `RR88131`, `RR04096`, `RR12624`)
- **Generation Logic**: Based on lane UUID, generates 5-digit number (00000-99999)
- **Consistency**: Same RR# used across CSV export, recap page, and database
- **Padding**: Always 5 digits with leading zeros (e.g., `RR00001`, `RR00042`)

### User Feedback:
> "RR numbers are still not to spec"

### ‚ùì Question for User:
**What is the correct RR# format you want?**

**Option A**: Date-based format
- Example: `RR251105001` (YYMMDD + sequence)
- Format: `RR` + 2-digit year + 2-digit month + 2-digit day + 3-digit sequence
- Screenshot shows `RR88131` which could be interpreted as date `88` `13` `1`?

**Option B**: Sequential without leading zeros
- Example: `RR1`, `RR2`, `RR3`, `RR42`, `RR523`
- Found in old docs: "no leading zeros for DAT"
- Simpler but less sortable

**Option C**: Current format with different logic
- Keep `RR#####` format but change how numbers are generated
- Sequential per day/week?
- Starting number?

**Option D**: Something else entirely
- Please describe the exact format needed

## üó∫Ô∏è Heat Map Display - FIXED

### Problem:
Heat maps uploaded successfully but not displaying on dashboard

### Root Cause:
Database save was failing silently - images in storage but no record in `dat_market_images` table

### Solution:
- Enhanced logging in upload API
- Better error handling for database operations
- Equipment type mapping (ensure consistency)

### Changes Made:
```javascript
// Before: Silent failure
try {
  await adminSupabase.from('dat_market_images').upsert(...)
} catch (dbError) {
  console.warn('Database save failed:', dbError);
  // Silently continues
}

// After: Verbose logging
const { data, error: dbError } = await adminSupabase
  .from('dat_market_images')
  .upsert(...);

if (dbError) {
  console.error('‚ùå Database save failed:', dbError);
} else {
  console.log('‚úÖ Database saved successfully');
}
```

### Equipment Type Mapping:
The component uses these values:
- `'dry-van'` ‚Üí Should save as `'dry-van'` in database
- `'reefer'` ‚Üí Should save as `'reefer'` in database
- `'flatbed'` ‚Üí Should save as `'flatbed'` in database

**Important**: Equipment type must match exactly between:
1. Admin page upload selection
2. Dashboard tab selection
3. Database `equipment_type` column
4. Storage bucket filename

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test Heat Map After Deployment:

1. **Re-upload Heat Maps**:
   - Go to `/admin`
   - Select equipment type (Dry Van, Reefer, or Flatbed)
   - Upload heat map image
   - Wait for success message
   - Check browser console for logs

2. **Verify Database Storage**:
```bash
# Run this to check database
node check-uploaded-images.mjs
```

3. **View on Dashboard**:
   - Go to `/dashboard`
   - Click equipment tabs (Dry Van, Reefer, Flatbed)
   - Heat map should appear in the large section
   - Should show your uploaded image, not placeholder

4. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Look for:
     - `‚úÖ Image uploaded successfully: [URL]`
     - `‚úÖ Database saved successfully`
   - If errors appear, copy and send them

### Test RR# Format:

1. **Check Recap Page**:
   - Go to `/recap`
   - Look at RR# column in table
   - Current format: `RR04096`, `RR88131`, etc.

2. **Export CSV**:
   - Click "üìä Export CSV"
   - Open downloaded file
   - Check "Reference ID" column (last column)
   - Should match recap page format

3. **Tell Me**:
   - Is this format correct?
   - If not, what format do you need?
   - Example of correct RR#?

## üìã Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed:
- Heat map upload API using Supabase Storage
- Enhanced logging for troubleshooting
- CSV export button on recap page
- Simplified recap UI (removed duplicate city displays)
- RR# table as primary display

### ‚è≥ Pending User Input:
- Correct RR# format specification
- Re-upload heat maps to test fix
- Feedback on whether maps now display

### ‚ùì Questions for User:
1. What is the correct RR# format? (See options above)
2. After re-uploading heat maps, do they appear on dashboard?
3. Any other issues with the recap page display?

## üöÄ Deployment

**Status**: Enhanced upload API deployed (commit d79a3cd)  
**Action Required**: User needs to re-upload heat maps for database to populate  
**Verification**: Run `node check-uploaded-images.mjs` to see database records

---

## üìû Next Steps

1. **User**: Clarify desired RR# format
2. **User**: Re-upload heat maps on Admin page
3. **User**: Verify heat maps display on Dashboard
4. **Developer**: Implement correct RR# format once specified
5. **Developer**: Verify heat maps are saving to database
