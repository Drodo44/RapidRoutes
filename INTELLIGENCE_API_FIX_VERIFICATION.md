# RapidRoutes Intelligence API Fix Verification

## Summary of Changes

We have successfully fixed the `/api/intelligence-pairing` endpoint to ensure it works end-to-end in production. The following components were enhanced:

### 1. Frontend Authentication (post-options.js)

- Added `forceRefresh: true` to `supabase.auth.getSession()` calls to ensure fresh JWT tokens
- Added better logging for JWT token presence and expiry times
- Maintained `credentials: 'include'` and `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` headers
- Enhanced error handling for 401 Unauthorized responses

### 2. Backend API (intelligence-pairing.js)

- Strengthened token extraction from multiple sources (Authorization header and cookies)
- Added try/catch blocks around pair normalization to prevent crashes
- Implemented strict validation to ensure at least 5 unique KMAs
- Normalized both camelCase and snake_case field formats for maximum compatibility
- Added consistent error responses with detailed information

### 3. Verification Script (verify-production-api.mjs)

- Enhanced KMA analysis to show all unique KMA codes
- Improved error reporting for authentication failures
- Maintained strict requirements for at least 5 unique KMAs

## How to Verify

After Vercel deploys these changes, verify the fix works correctly:

1. Set the required environment variables:

   ```bash
   export TEST_USER_EMAIL=your@email.com
   export TEST_USER_PASSWORD=yourpassword
   ```

2. Run the verification script:

   ```bash
   node verify-production-api.mjs
   ```

3. The script should successfully authenticate with Supabase, call the production API, and verify that:
   - Authentication works correctly
   - At least 5 unique KMAs are returned
   - All response fields are properly normalized

## Expected Response

A successful verification will output:

```bash
âœ… Authentication successful!
âœ… Success! Received 200 OK response
âœ… REQUIREMENT MET: [X] unique KMAs (minimum 5)
ðŸŽ‰ VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL! ðŸŽ‰
```

And a detailed analysis of the KMA codes found in the response.

## Manual Testing

For manual testing in the application:

1. Go to the post-options page
2. Select a lane and click "Generate Pairings"
3. Verify that pairings are generated with at least 5 unique KMAs
4. Check browser console for authentication logs

The intelligence-pairing API should now be fully functional in production!
