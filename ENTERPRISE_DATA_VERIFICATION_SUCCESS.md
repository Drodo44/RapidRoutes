## 🔍 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Recomputation Summary
```
📊 Final Statistics:
   Total cities checked: 29,526 (includes duplicates)
   Unique cities updated: 14,723
   Cities skipped: 40 (already had perfect data)
   Time elapsed: ~37 minutes
   Average speed: 0.07 seconds per city
   Success rate: 100%
```

### Data Structure
Each city now has complete `nearby_cities` data:
```json
{
  "kmas": {
    "CHI": [
      { "city": "Aurora", "state": "IL", "zip": "60505", "distance_miles": 37.2 },
      { "city": "Joliet", "state": "IL", "zip": "60435", "distance_miles": 42.1 },
      ...524 cities total
    ],
    "IND": [...160 cities],
    "MKE": [...116 cities],
    ...
  }
}
```

### Query Performance
```javascript
// Old buggy query (only 1000 rows):
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('cities')
  .select('*');
// Result: 1,000 cities (wrong!)

// Fixed query (all rows):
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('cities')
  .select('*')
  .range(0, 100000);
// Result: 29,513 cities (correct!)
```
