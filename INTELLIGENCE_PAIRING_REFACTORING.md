# Intelligence Pairing API - Fallback Mechanism Refactoring

## Key Changes

1. **Removed Automatic Emergency Fallback Mode**
   - Eliminated the hardcoded `forceEmergencyMode = true` that was forcing all requests to use emergency data
   - Added query parameter support: `?force_emergency=true` for testing/debugging

2. **Added Intelligent Result Validation**
   - Created comprehensive validation logic that checks:
     - Minimum count of city pairs (not just empty array check)
     - Required KMA diversity (6+ unique KMAs per origin/destination)
     - Data integrity (city names, states present)
     - Incomplete data ratio analysis

3. **Implemented Two-Step Intelligent Recovery**
   - When validation fails, system now attempts recovery with expanded parameters:
     - Doubles search radius
     - Re-runs city search with expanded criteria
     - Re-validates pairs before acceptance

4. **Enhanced Emergency Fallback Logic**
   - Created dedicated `generateEmergencyFallbackPairs()` function
   - Added customizable parameters:
     - Minimum KMA diversity
     - Target pair count
     - Origin/destination city preservation

5. **Improved Error Reporting**
   - Added detailed `dataSourceType` field in metadata
   - Enhanced metadata with specific fallback reason
   - Included recovery attempt tracking
   - Added precise error classification

6. **Added Debugging Information**
   - Clear console logging for troubleshooting
   - Step-by-step recovery attempt reporting
   - KMA diversity metrics
   - Explicit error conditions

## Testing Instructions

1. Test normal operation: `/api/intelligence-pairing` - should use real data
2. Force emergency mode: `/api/intelligence-pairing?force_emergency=true` - should use emergency data
3. Test recovery: Modify city data to have insufficient KMAs - should attempt recovery before fallback

## Benefits

- **Resilience**: System now makes multiple attempts before using emergency data
- **Transparency**: Clear reporting on why fallback was used
- **Flexibility**: Can tune fallback behavior with parameters
- **Quality**: Maintains KMA diversity requirements even in emergency mode
