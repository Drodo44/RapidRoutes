# Variable Redeclaration Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes applied to address variable redeclaration issues in the `intelligence-pairing.js` API endpoint. These changes should resolve the Vercel build failures.

## Changes Made

1. Created a `normalizeFields` function at the top of the file to normalize various field names:

   ```javascript
   const normalizeFields = (body) => {
     return {
       laneId: body.lane_id || body.laneId || '',
       originCity: body.origin_city || body.originCity || '',
       originState: body.origin_state || body.originState || '',
       originZip: body.origin_zip || body.originZip || '',
       destinationCity: body.destination_city || body.destCity || body.dest_city || body.destinationCity || '',
       destinationState: body.destination_state || body.destState || body.dest_state || body.destinationState || '',
       destinationZip: body.destination_zip || body.destZip || body.dest_zip || body.destinationZip || '',
       equipmentCode: body.equipment_code || body.equipmentCode || 'V',
       test_mode: body.test_mode || false,
       mock_auth: body.mock_auth || null,
     };
   };
   ```

2. Replaced the duplicated variable extraction code with a single call to `normalizeFields`:

   ```javascript
   // Normalize all fields in one step
   const fields = normalizeFields(req.body);
   
   // Destructure the normalized fields for use in the rest of the function
   const { laneId, originCity, originState, originZip, destinationCity, destinationState, destinationZip, equipmentCode } = fields;
   ```

3. Updated references to test mode and mock auth settings:

   ```javascript
   const isTestRequest = fields.test_mode === true;
   const mockParam = req.query?.mock_auth || fields.mock_auth;
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Elimination of variable redeclarations**: The previous code was declaring the same variables multiple times (e.g., `originCity`, `destinationCity`, etc.) which causes errors in the Vercel build process.

2. **Improved field normalization**: All field normalization is now centralized in a single function, making it easier to maintain and extend.

3. **Better code structure**: The code is now more organized, with clear separation between field normalization and business logic.

## Testing

The changes have been tested locally to ensure that the API endpoint still functions correctly. The modifications address the syntax issues that were causing the Vercel build to fail, while maintaining the same functionality.
