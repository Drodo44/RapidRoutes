# Fix for Intelligence API 400 Bad Request Errors

## Issue Summary

The intelligence-pairing API was returning 400 Bad Request errors when called from the frontend. After extensive debugging, we identified the issue as a parameter name mismatch between what the frontend sends and what the geographic crawl function expects.

## Root Cause

The frontend sends:
- `destinationCity` and `destinationState`

But the `generateGeographicCrawlPairs` function expects:
- `destCity` and `destState`

## Solution

We've implemented an adapter pattern that formats the API requests correctly without modifying any protected files. This approach:

1. Creates a new adapter utility (`intelligenceApiAdapter.js`)
2. Uses the adapter to make API calls with correctly named parameters
3. Maintains compatibility with the existing API

## Files Changed

- ✅ NEW: `/utils/intelligenceApiAdapter.js` - API adapter implementation
- ✅ UPDATED: Frontend files that call the intelligence-pairing API

## Testing Done

- Created test scripts to verify different parameter formats
- Implemented a debug page for interactive testing
- Verified fix works with various lane configurations

## Implementation Notes

- No protected files were modified in this fix
- The solution maintains full compatibility with the existing API
- Added better error handling and debugging information
