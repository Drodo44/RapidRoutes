# Authentication Token Fix Summary

## Problem Description

API calls to `/api/intelligence-pairing` were failing with a 401 Unauthorized error:

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "details": "Missing authentication token. Please provide a valid token via Authorization header.",
  "code": "AUTH_TOKEN_MISSING"
}
```

The token authentication was successfully validated in the client but was not being included in the HTTP request to the API.

## Root Cause

The `intelligenceApiAdapter.js` utility was not including the `Authorization` header in its fetch request, despite the token being available and valid in the client. Logs showed:

```
"üîê Auth check for batch generation: tokenValid: true"
```text

But the request headers did not include the token.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `intelligenceApiAdapter.js`

- Added a `token` parameter to the `callIntelligencePairingApi` function to accept the authentication token
- Modified the fetch request to include the Authorization header when a token is provided:

```javascript
// Setup request headers
const headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
};

// Add Authorization header if token is provided
if (token) {
  console.log('üîê Adding authorization token to request');
  headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${token}`;
} else {
  console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: No authorization token provided for API request');
}
```

### 2. Updated `post-options.js`

- Modified the call to `callIntelligencePairingApi` to pass the token from `ensureAuthReady()`:

```javascript
const result = await callIntelligencePairingApi(lane, {
  useTestMode: false
}, token); // Pass the token from ensureAuthReady
```

### 3. Fixed Field Validation

- Updated the field validation in the adapter to match the API's expected field names:
  - Changed `dest_city` to `destination_city`
  - Changed `dest_state` to `destination_state`
- This prevents misleading validation error messages in the logs

## Verification

After these changes, the adapter will include the authentication token in its API requests, which should resolve the 401 Unauthorized errors.

## Additional Notes

The field validation was showing misleading errors because it was still looking for `dest_city` and `dest_state`, while the API and payload were correctly using `destination_city` and `destination_state`. This has been fixed to ensure more accurate error reporting.

## Next Steps

1. Test the changes by attempting to generate pairings for a lane
2. Verify that the Authorization header is being included in the request
3. Check for any other authentication issues that may arise
