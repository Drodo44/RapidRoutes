# Final Security Step: Disable Test Mode

## Verification Complete

All verification steps have been successfully completed:

- ✅ Build error fixed (missing lib/intelligenceApi.js created)
- ✅ Deployment successful
- ✅ Intelligence API working with test_mode=true
- ✅ KMA diversity requirement (6+ unique KMAs) enforced and verified
- ✅ Production verification endpoint functional

## Required Security Action

Now that all verification is complete, the test mode must be disabled to secure the production environment:

1. Log in to the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select the RapidRoutes project
3. Go to Settings > Environment Variables
4. Find the variable:
   - Name: `ALLOW_TEST_MODE`
   - Current Value: `true`
5. Change the value to `false`
6. Save the changes and redeploy the application

## Security Implications

Leaving test mode enabled in production would allow:

- API calls without proper authentication
- Bypassing of security controls
- Potential exposure of sensitive data
- Unauthorized access to intelligence pairing functionality

## Confirmation Required

After changing the environment variable:

1. Confirm the deployment completes successfully
2. Verify that test_mode=true no longer works (should return 401 Unauthorized)
3. Verify that normal authenticated API calls still work correctly

## Final Status

Once ALLOW_TEST_MODE is set to false, the RapidRoutes application will be fully secured and ready for production use.
