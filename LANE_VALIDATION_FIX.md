# Lane Validation Fix Summary

## Validation Changes Implemented

The lane validation logic has been updated across three key files to allow lanes with partial destination data to pass validation. Previously, lanes required both `destination_city` AND `destination_state` to be defined, which was causing valid lanes with only one destination field to fail validation.

### Files Updated

1. **`/pages/post-options.js`**

   ```javascript
   const hasDestinationData = destinationCity || destinationState;
   
   // NEW VALIDATION LOGIC: Requires origin fields + equipment, allows EITHER destinationCity OR destinationState
   if (!originCity || !originState || !hasDestinationData || !equipmentCode) {
     console.error("❌ Lane invalid:", { 
       laneId: lane.id, 
       originCity: !!originCity, 
       originState: !!originState, 
       destinationCity: !!destinationCity, 
       destinationState: !!destinationState, 
       hasDestinationData, 
       equipmentCode: !!equipmentCode 
     });
   ```

2. **`/pages/api/intelligence-pairing.js`**

   ```javascript
   // Check required fields - requires origin fields + equipment, allows EITHER destination_city OR destination_state
   const hasDestinationData = normalizedFields.destination_city || normalizedFields.destination_state;
   
   // NEW VALIDATION LOGIC: Requires origin fields + equipment, allows EITHER destination_city OR destination_state
   if (!normalizedFields.origin_city || !normalizedFields.origin_state || !hasDestinationData || !normalizedFields.equipment_code) {
     console.error("❌ Lane invalid:", { 
       lane_id: normalizedFields.lane_id, 
       origin_city: !!normalizedFields.origin_city, 
       origin_state: !!normalizedFields.origin_state, 
       destination_city: !!normalizedFields.destination_city, 
       destination_state: !!normalizedFields.destination_state, 
       has_destination_data: !!hasDestinationData, 
       equipment_code: !!normalizedFields.equipment_code 
     });
   ```

3. **`/utils/intelligenceApiAdapter.js`**

   ```javascript
   // Validate required fields are present and non-null
   // Updated validation: requires origin fields + equipment, allows EITHER destination_city OR destination_state
   const hasDestinationData = payload.destination_city || payload.destination_state;
   
   if (!payload.origin_city || !payload.origin_state || !hasDestinationData || !payload.equipment_code) {
     console.error("❌ Lane invalid:", { 
       lane_id: payload.lane_id, 
       origin_city: !!payload.origin_city, 
       origin_state: !!payload.origin_state, 
       destination_city: !!payload.destination_city, 
       destination_state: !!payload.destination_state, 
       has_destination_data: !!hasDestinationData, 
       equipment_code: !!payload.equipment_code 
     });
   ```

## Validation Requirements

### Required Fields

- Origin City
- Origin State  
- Equipment Code

### Destination Data

- At least ONE of the following:
  - Destination City
  - Destination State

### Enhanced Logging

- All validation checks now include detailed logging with field status
- Each component logs both validation pass/fail status
- Error responses include detailed information about missing fields

## Testing and Verification

The build process has completed successfully, indicating that the validation logic changes are syntactically correct. The next step is to deploy these changes and test them in the production environment.

## Next Steps

1. Push changes to the main branch to deploy to production
2. Test lanes with:
   - Complete data (all fields populated)
   - Only destination city (no destination state)
   - Only destination state (no destination city)
3. Verify proper error handling when neither destination field is provided

The validation changes will allow for more flexible lane creation and pairing, especially in cases where only partial destination information is available.
