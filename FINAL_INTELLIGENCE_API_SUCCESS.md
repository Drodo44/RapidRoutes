# FINAL INTELLIGENCE API SUCCESS REPORT
    
## Overview

The intelligence-pairing API has been successfully verified with the following details:

- **Date:** September 24, 2025
- **Environment:** Development
- **Verification Method:** Direct API testing with browser inspection
- **Test Mode Used:** No

## Sample Working Payload

```json
{
  "origin_city": "Columbus",
  "origin_state": "OH",
  "destination_city": "Chicago",
  "destination_state": "IL",
  "equipment_code": "V"
}
```

## Required Headers

```http
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

## Verification Summary

- ✅ **Token Validation:** Authentication token was properly passed and accepted
- ✅ **Payload Format:** Correct snake_case keys used (origin_city, destination_city)
- ✅ **API Response:** 200 OK with valid response data including KMA information
- ✅ **Data Structure:** Correct KMA codes and location data returned
- ✅ **Output Format:** Properly formatted response with snake_case keys

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures:**
   - Check that the token is being passed in the Authorization header
   - Verify token format is "Bearer {token}"
   - Ensure user has proper permissions in Supabase
   - Check token expiration (Supabase tokens expire after 1 hour by default)

2. **400 Bad Request Errors:**
   - Verify all required fields are present (origin_city, origin_state, destination_city, destination_state)
   - Check that field names use snake_case, not camelCase (common mistake: destinationCity vs destination_city)
   - Ensure state codes are valid 2-letter abbreviations
   - Verify city names are present in the database

3. **500 Server Errors:**
   - Check server logs for database connection issues
   - Verify Supabase service role key is valid
   - Check for rate limiting on the Supabase instance
   - Ensure the .env file contains the correct SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

4. **KMA Lookup Failures:**
   - Verify cities exist in the database with correct spelling
   - Check that the KMA code mapping is correctly set up
   - Ensure proper case sensitivity is maintained (most city lookups are case-insensitive but use normalize() function)

### API Request Structure

For consistent operation, ensure requests follow this pattern:

1. Use the intelligenceApiAdapter.js utility to ensure proper formatting
2. Always include all required fields: origin_city, origin_state, destination_city, destination_state
3. Always include an equipment_code (default: "V")
4. Send properly formatted Authorization header with token

### Validation Checklist

- [x] Authentication token in Authorization header
- [x] All keys in snake_case format
- [x] Valid city names in database
- [x] Valid state/province codes
- [x] Equipment code provided (default: 'V')
