# Final Fix Verification Report

## Fixes Completed

### 1. Field Naming Consistency

The following field naming inconsistencies have been fixed:

- In `pages/post-options.js`: Replaced all occurrences of `dest_city` and `dest_state` with `destination_city` and `destination_state`
- In `utils/intelligenceApiAdapter.js`:
  - Updated required fields validation to check for `destination_city` and `destination_state`
  - Updated debug logging to reference `destination_city` and `destination_state`
  - Updated field mapping to prioritize `destination_city` and `destination_state`

### 2. Authorization Header

Added proper Authorization header in `utils/intelligenceApiAdapter.js`:

- Now retrieving token from `localStorage.getItem('supabase.auth.token')`
- Including Authorization header with Bearer token in API requests

### 3. CSV Export Function

Fixed the CSV export functionality in `utils/exportDatCsv.js`:

- Updated to use `destination_city` and `destination_state` instead of `dest_city` and `dest_state`
- Added null fallbacks to prevent errors when fields are missing

## Verification Steps

To verify these fixes:

1. Log into the application
2. Create a new lane with origin and destination information
3. Test the lane pairing functionality
4. Export data to CSV format
5. Verify that all API requests succeed with proper authorization

## API Contract

The API now correctly expects:

- `origin_city` and `origin_state` fields
- `destination_city` and `destination_state` fields (not `dest_city` or `dest_state`)
- Authorization header with a valid Bearer token

All data transformations consistently maintain this naming convention.

## Next Steps

Tag this commit as `v1.2.1-intelligence-patch` to mark the successful implementation of these fixes.
