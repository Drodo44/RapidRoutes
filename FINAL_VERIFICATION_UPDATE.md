# Final Verification Update

## Test Mode Enhancement

The test mode feature has been enhanced to work properly in both development and production environments. This enables proper verification of the API without requiring manual user credentials.

### Changes Made

1. Removed the restriction that limited test_mode to non-production environments
2. Updated the authentication logic to recognize test_mode in all environments when ALLOW_TEST_MODE=true
3. Added clearer documentation about the test mode parameter

### Configuration Required

To enable test mode in production, the ALLOW_TEST_MODE environment variable must be set to 'true' in the Vercel deployment settings.

### How to Use

Send a request to the API with the `test_mode: true` parameter:

```json
{
  "test_mode": true,
  "originCity": "Cincinnati",
  "originState": "OH",
  "destCity": "Chicago",
  "destState": "IL",
  "equipmentCode": "V"
}
```

### Security Considerations

- Test mode should only be enabled temporarily for verification purposes
- When enabled, it bypasses authentication but still enforces all business rules
- After verification, ALLOW_TEST_MODE should be set back to 'false'

## Next Steps

1. Push these changes to the main branch
2. Add the ALLOW_TEST_MODE=true environment variable in Vercel
3. Run the direct-prod-verification.mjs script to verify the API works as expected
4. After verification, set ALLOW_TEST_MODE=false for security
