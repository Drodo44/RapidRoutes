# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: FREIGHT INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM PROTECTION

## üö´ DO NOT MODIFY THE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM

The freight intelligence system in this codebase is **production-critical** and has been carefully tuned to ensure:

- Minimum 6 unique KMAs per lane
- 75-mile radius city crawling
- Proper market distribution
- DAT compliance
- Geographic validation

### Protected Files

- `lib/FreightIntelligence.js` - Core intelligence engine
- `lib/diverseCrawl.js` - KMA diversity logic
- `lib/geographicCrawl.js` - City pair generation
- `lib/datCsvBuilder.js` - DAT format compliance

### Historical Context

Previous modifications to the intelligence system resulted in:

- Broken city sourcing
- Invalid KMA distributions
- Failed DAT validations
- Lost market coverage

### Approved Changes Only

Any modifications to the intelligence system must be:

1. Approved by lead architect
2. Fully tested with comprehensive validation
3. Documented with before/after KMA analysis
4. Verified against DAT requirements
5. Deployed with full backup contingency

### Alternative Solutions

Instead of modifying the intelligence system:

- Add new validation layers on top
- Implement pre/post processing
- Create companion services
- Use the monitoring API
