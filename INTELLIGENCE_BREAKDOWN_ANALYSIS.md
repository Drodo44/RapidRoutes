# 🚨 INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM INPUT STRUCTURE DIAGNOSTIC

## Root Cause Identified: Data Structure Mismatch

### Expected Input Structure:
```javascript
{
  origin: { city: "Cincinnati", state: "OH" },
  destination: { city: "Philadelphia", state: "PA" },
  equipment: "FD"
}
```

### Actual Input Being Passed:
```javascript
{
  origin_city: "Cincinnati",
  origin_state: "OH", 
  dest_city: "Philadelphia",
  dest_state: "PA",
  equipment_code: "FD"
}
```

## Intelligence System Failure Point:
- ❌ Input validation fails immediately
- ❌ Never reaches city database queries
- ❌ Never reaches KMA uniqueness logic
- ❌ Never reaches HERE.com fallback
- ❌ Returns error before any freight intelligence processing

## This Explains the CSV Export Failures:
The 422 "No valid freight data generated" error occurs because the intelligence system fails on input parsing, not because of insufficient KMA pairs or database issues.

## Next Step: Test with Correct Input Structure
Need to verify if the intelligence system works when given properly structured input data.
