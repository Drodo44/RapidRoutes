# Missing Cities Analysis

## Attempted Verification

We attempted to verify the presence of the following cities in your Supabase database:

- Pasco, WA
- Vancouver, WA
- Russellville, AR
- Frisco, TX

## Technical Issues

We encountered DNS resolution issues when trying to connect to your Supabase instance:
`getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND vywvmhdyyhkdpmbfzkgx.supabase.co`

This could be due to:
1. Network connectivity issues in the development environment
2. The Supabase project URL may be incorrect or the project may have been removed
3. Supabase service may be temporarily unavailable

## Recommendations

Based on the error messages from the production API and our verification attempts, we believe these cities are likely missing from your database. Here's what we recommend:

### Option 1: Direct Database Access

If you have direct access to your Supabase database:

1. Connect to your Supabase SQL editor
2. Run the following queries to check if these cities exist:

```sql
-- Check for each city
SELECT * FROM cities WHERE city ILIKE 'Pasco' AND state_or_province = 'WA';
SELECT * FROM cities WHERE city ILIKE 'Vancouver' AND state_or_province = 'WA';
SELECT * FROM cities WHERE city ILIKE 'Russellville' AND state_or_province = 'AR';
SELECT * FROM cities WHERE city ILIKE 'Frisco' AND state_or_province = 'TX';
```

3. For any missing cities, insert them with the following SQL (you'll need to determine the appropriate coordinates and KMA codes):

```sql
-- Example insert statement (replace values as needed)
INSERT INTO cities (city, state_or_province, zip, latitude, longitude, kma_code, kma_name)
VALUES ('Pasco', 'WA', '99301', 46.2395, -119.1005, 'KMA123', 'Nearby KMA Name');
```

### Option 2: Use the Supabase Dashboard

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the Table Editor
3. Select the "cities" table
4. Manually check for these cities
5. Use the "Insert Row" feature to add any missing cities

### Option 3: Frontend Updates

In the meantime, you can update the frontend to better handle these errors:

1. We've already enhanced error handling in `post-options.js` to better display city lookup errors
2. You can add a check in your lane creation form to verify cities exist before allowing submission
3. Consider adding a city management interface to allow adding missing cities directly from the application

## Next Steps

1. Verify city existence in your production database using direct database access
2. Add any missing cities with appropriate KMA codes
3. Deploy the updated frontend code with improved error handling
