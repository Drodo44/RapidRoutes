# API File Syntax Fixes

This document outlines the syntax issues in the intelligence-pairing.js file and how to fix them.

## Issue

There are syntax errors in the `pages/api/intelligence-pairing.js` file that prevent successful building in Vercel. The main issues are:

1. A missing catch block after try at around line 1138
2. Incorrect structure of try-catch blocks in the fallback generation code

## Fix

To fix the issues, apply the following changes:

1. Replace line 1138: Change `try {` to `{` to remove the unpaired try block:

```javascript
// CRITICAL FIX: Remove redundant stats calculation and fix try-catch structure
{ // Changed from try {
  // Ensure we always return a valid response even if pairs is empty
  // ... rest of code
```

2. Add a missing catch block after the try statement in the fallback data generation section:

```javascript
if (pairs.length < 6) {
  try {
    // ... existing fallback generation code
  } catch (fallbackError) {
    console.error("Error generating fallback data:", fallbackError);
  }
}
```

## Verification

After making these changes, run the syntax check to confirm:

```bash
node --check pages/api/intelligence-pairing.js
```

These fixes will resolve the syntax errors blocking the Vercel deployment.
