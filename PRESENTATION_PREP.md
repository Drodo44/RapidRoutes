# 🎯 Monday Presentation Prep Checklist

**Prepared for:** RapidRoutes 2.0 Launch Presentation  
**Date:** October 21, 2025 (Monday)  
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready with Minor Setup Required

---

## 📋 Pre-Presentation Setup (30 minutes)

### 1️⃣ Database Migration (REQUIRED) ⚡
**Priority:** HIGH - Must complete before demo  
**Time:** 5 minutes

```bash
# Execute from workspace root
psql $DATABASE_URL < sql/create-city-performance.sql
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Creates `city_performance` table for Smart City Learning
- ✅ Adds `coverage_source`, `lane_group_id`, `rr_number` to `lanes` table
- ✅ Creates indexes for performance
- ✅ Enables RLS policies

**Verification:**
```bash
npm run check:prod
```
Expected: All tests passing (10/10) ✅

---

### 2️⃣ Production Smoke Test ✅
**Priority:** HIGH - Verify all systems operational  
**Time:** 2 minutes

```bash
npm run check:prod
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Health Check API: 200 OK
- ✅ Auth Profile API: 401 (expected without token)
- ✅ Login Page: Logo and form present
- ✅ Recap Page: 200 OK
- ✅ City Performance API: 200 OK (after migration)
- ✅ Export Recap HTML API: Validates methods
- ✅ Static Assets: Serving correctly

**Current Status:** 9/10 passing (City Performance pending migration)

---

### 3️⃣ Test Login Flow 🔐
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Verify auth fix  
**Time:** 3 minutes

1. Navigate to https://rapid-routes.vercel.app/login
2. Check logo displays at 160px with cyan ring
3. Sign in with credentials
4. Verify redirect to dashboard (no 500 error)
5. Check `/api/auth/profile` returns 200 OK

**What was fixed:**
- Auth Profile API migrated to singleton pattern
- Comprehensive error logging with `[Profile API]` prefix
- Auto-profile creation for missing users
- No more 500 errors on login! ✅

---

### 4️⃣ Demo Data Preparation 📊
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Have sample data ready  
**Time:** 10 minutes

**Create Sample Lanes:**
1. Navigate to Lane Manager
2. Create 3-5 active lanes with diverse origins/destinations
3. Use mix of equipment types (FD, V, R)
4. Set realistic pickup dates (next 7 days)
5. Add meaningful comments and commodities

**Example Lanes:**
```
Lane 1: Chicago, IL → Dallas, TX (FD, 42,000 lbs, Steel Beams)
Lane 2: Los Angeles, CA → Phoenix, AZ (V, 35,000 lbs, Electronics)
Lane 3: Atlanta, GA → Miami, FL (R, 38,000 lbs, Produce)
Lane 4: Houston, TX → Denver, CO (FD, 45,000 lbs, Machinery)
Lane 5: Seattle, WA → Portland, OR (V, 28,000 lbs, Furniture)

## 🛠️ Technical Q&A Prep

### Architecture Questions

**Q: What tech stack powers RapidRoutes 2.0?**
A: Next.js 14 (Pages Router), Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS, Vercel deployment, React with Tailwind CSS

**Q: How does realtime sync work?**
A: Supabase Realtime channels subscribe to `lanes` table changes, pushing updates to all connected clients instantly

**Q: Is the HTML export truly offline?**
A: Yes! All JavaScript is embedded inline - no external dependencies. Works on air-gapped machines.

---

### Data Questions

**Q: How do you determine starred cities?**
A: Auto-starred when: `covers_ibc >= 5` OR `(covers_ibc + covers_obc + covers_email) >= 10`

**Q: What database changes were made?**
A: Added `city_performance` table, `coverage_source`/`lane_group_id`/`rr_number` fields to lanes, indexes for performance

**Q: Can we customize the starring thresholds?**
A: Yes - edit `/api/city-performance.js` constants: `IBC_THRESHOLD = 5`, `TOTAL_THRESHOLD = 10`

---

### Feature Questions

**Q: Why 3 coverage methods (IBC, OBC, Email)?**
A: Tracks how loads are booked - helps identify best acquisition channels and optimize outreach strategy

**Q: How does the RR# search work?**
A: Client-side filtering on `rr_number` field - instant response, no API calls

**Q: Can we export multiple recaps at once?**
A: Current version exports current view. Future enhancement: batch export by date range

## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: City Performance Table Not Found (Before Migration)

**Fix:** Run `psql $DATABASE_URL < sql/create-city-performance.sql`  
**Status:** ⚠️ Required before demo

### Issue 2: Starred Cities Not Displaying
**Cause:** No cities have reached thresholds yet  
**Workaround:** Manually mark same city covered 5+ times with IBC  
**Status:** Expected behavior with new database

### Issue 3: RR# Search Behind Auth (Production Test)
**Note:** Search functionality requires login  
**Status:** Working as intended for security
