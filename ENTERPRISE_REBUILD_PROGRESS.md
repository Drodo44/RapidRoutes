## COMPONENT EXAMPLES BUILT
```css
.card              /* Clean card with shadow */
.btn-primary       /* Professional button */
.badge-active      /* Status badge */
.table             /* Dense data table */
.form-input        /* Clean form field */
.stat-card         /* Dashboard stat cards */
.tabs              /* Clean tab navigation */
```

## WHAT'S DIFFERENT FROM OLD UI
### OLD (Before tonight)
- Too many Tailwind classes inline
- Dark-only hardcoded colors
- Cards too spaced out (wasteful)
- No light mode option
- GameBoy-looking UI (user quote)
- No keyboard shortcuts
- Unprofessional feeling

### NEW (After tonight)
- CSS variables for theming
- Dark + Light mode toggle
- Compact dense layouts
- Professional color palette
- Banking app aesthetics
- Power user shortcuts
- Enterprise-grade polish

## NEXT FILE TO REBUILD
`pages/lanes.js` - Complete rewrite with:
1. Stat cards row at top
2. Compact form (2-3 rows max)
3. Table view of lanes
4. Professional styling throughout
