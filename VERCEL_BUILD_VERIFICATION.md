# Vercel Build Verification

## Fix Confirmation

The syntax error in `pages/post-options.js` has been successfully fixed:

- **Issue:** Missing closing brace `}` for the `requestBody` object
- **Fix:** Added proper closing brace and semicolon, removed trailing comma
- **Commit:** b480ca3fe41c7cc913aa889c7f198b46fae09238
- **Tag:** v1.2.1-intelligence-patch

## Tag Verification

The tag `v1.2.1-intelligence-patch` correctly points to commit b480ca3 with the message "Fix syntax error in post-options.js (missing closing brace for requestBody object)".

## Remote Sync Verification

- Local `main` branch and remote `origin/main` are synchronized (both at b480ca3)
- The tag has been pushed to the remote repository

## Build Verification

- Local build with `npm run build` completes successfully with no syntax errors
- The only warning is unrelated to our fix (dependency issue in repo-health.js)
- All pages compiled successfully

## Expected Vercel Outcome

With the syntax error fixed, Vercel should now be able to successfully build and deploy the application. The build error related to the missing closing brace in the `requestBody` object definition has been resolved.

## Vercel Deployment Verification

To verify the successful deployment on Vercel:

1. **Access Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Select the `RapidRoutes` project

2. **Check Deployment Status**:
   - Look for the latest deployment triggered from commit `2dbd48b` (or later)
   - Verify that the build logs show successful completion
   - Confirm there are no JavaScript syntax errors related to `post-options.js`

3. **Access Production URL**:
   - Once deployment is complete, access the production URL provided by Vercel
   - Standard format would be: `https://rapidroutes-[unique-id].vercel.app`
   - Or your custom domain if configured

4. **Verify Application Functionality**:
   - Test the lane pairing functionality to ensure it works correctly
   - Confirm API requests are properly formatted with destination_city/destination_state
   - Verify CSV exports are generated correctly
