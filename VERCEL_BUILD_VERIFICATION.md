# Vercel Build Verification

## Fix Confirmation

The syntax error in `pages/post-options.js` has been successfully fixed:

- **Issue:** Missing closing brace `}` for the `requestBody` object
- **Fix:** Added proper closing brace and semicolon, removed trailing comma
- **Commit:** b480ca3fe41c7cc913aa889c7f198b46fae09238
- **Tag:** v1.2.1-intelligence-patch

## Tag Verification

The tag `v1.2.1-intelligence-patch` correctly points to commit b480ca3 with the message "Fix syntax error in post-options.js (missing closing brace for requestBody object)".

## Remote Sync Verification

- Local `main` branch and remote `origin/main` are synchronized (both at b480ca3)
- The tag has been pushed to the remote repository

## Build Verification

- Local build with `npm run build` completes successfully with no syntax errors
- The only warning is unrelated to our fix (dependency issue in repo-health.js)
- All pages compiled successfully

## Expected Vercel Outcome

With the syntax error fixed, Vercel should now be able to successfully build and deploy the application. The build error related to the missing closing brace in the `requestBody` object definition has been resolved.
