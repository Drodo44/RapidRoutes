# RapidRoutes API Deployment Fix

## Issue Identified

The RapidRoutes application's API routes were not working correctly in production, causing the intelligence-pairing endpoint to fail with a 405 Method Not Allowed error. The API was returning HTML content instead of JSON responses, indicating a deployment configuration issue.

## Root Cause

1. **Conflicting Configuration Files**: Both `next.config.mjs` and `next.config.cjs` were present, causing conflicts in the build process.
2. **ESM Module Issues**: The project is configured with `"type": "module"` in `package.json` but the Next.js configuration wasn't properly set up for ESM compatibility.
3. **Vercel Configuration**: The Vercel deployment wasn't correctly configured to treat the project as a Next.js application with API routes.

## Applied Fixes

1. **Consolidated Configuration Files**
   - Backed up the existing configuration files
   - Created a unified `next.config.js` file with proper Next.js API route configuration
   - Added explicit ESM compatibility settings

2. **Updated Vercel Configuration**
   - Created a comprehensive `vercel.json` file
   - Specified Next.js as the framework
   - Set the correct build command and output directory

3. **Added API Verification Endpoints**
   - Created `/api/deployment-verification.js` to validate API routing
   - Created `/api/verify-intelligence.js` to test authentication flow

4. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Enhanced error responses to provide more detailed diagnostics
   - Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Verification Steps

After deploying these changes to Vercel, verify the fix by:

1. Testing the basic API endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl -X GET https://rapidroutes.vercel.app/api/deployment-verification
   ```

2. Checking the authentication verification endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" https://rapidroutes.vercel.app/api/verify-intelligence
   ```

3. Running the full authentication flow verification script:

   ```bash
   node verify-auth-flow.js https://rapidroutes.vercel.app YOUR_EMAIL YOUR_PASSWORD
   ```

4. Accessing the application and testing lane generation in the UI

## Next Steps

If issues persist after deploying these changes:

1. Check the Vercel deployment logs for any build errors
2. Verify all required environment variables are set correctly in Vercel
3. Make sure the Supabase service is operational and accessible
4. Run the verification scripts to pinpoint any remaining issues

## Files Modified

- Created: `next.config.js` (unified configuration)
- Created: `vercel.json` (with proper Next.js settings)
- Created: `/pages/api/deployment-verification.js`
- Created: `/pages/api/verify-intelligence.js`
- Created: `verify-auth-flow.js` (testing script)
- Created: `fix-deployment.js` (automated fix script)

These changes ensure that Next.js API routes work correctly with ESM modules and the Vercel deployment environment.
