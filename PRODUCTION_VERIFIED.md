# PRODUCTION VERIFICATION STATUS

## Current Status: ✅ SECURITY VERIFIED, ⏳ KMA VERIFICATION PENDING

## Security Verification

- ✅ Debug endpoints have been successfully removed (/api/debug-env, /api/auth-check, etc.)
- ✅ Test mode implementation has been added to intelligence-pairing.js
- ✅ Middleware security has been implemented

## KMA Diversity Implementation

- ✅ Updated geographicCrawl.js to enforce 6+ unique KMAs
- ✅ Removed fallback code that allowed 3-5 KMAs

## Pending Tasks

1. **Environment Variable Configuration**
   - The ALLOW_TEST_MODE environment variable needs to be set to 'true' in the Vercel dashboard
   - This will enable verification of the KMA diversity requirement without requiring authentication

2. **Verification Process**
   - After setting the environment variable, run the verification script:
   
     ```bash
     node scripts/verify-intelligence-api.mjs
     ```
   
   - Check that all lanes return at least 6 unique KMAs

3. **Final Security Step**
   - After successful verification, set ALLOW_TEST_MODE back to 'false' in the Vercel dashboard

## Production Readiness Checklist

- [x] Debug endpoints removed
- [x] Authentication security enforced
- [x] Test mode implementation added
- [x] KMA diversity requirement code implemented
- [ ] Verification of KMA diversity completed
- [ ] ALLOW_TEST_MODE disabled after verification

## Instructions for Vercel Environment Setup

1. Log in to the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select the RapidRoutes project
3. Go to Settings > Environment Variables
4. Add a new variable:
