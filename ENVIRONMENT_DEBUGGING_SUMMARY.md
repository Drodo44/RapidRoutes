# Environment Debugging Updates

## Added Debugging Tools

We've implemented enhanced debugging capabilities to diagnose environment variable and authentication issues:

1. **Debug Endpoint**:
   - Created a dedicated `/api/debug/environment` endpoint for environment diagnostics
   - Provides detailed information about configuration variables and runtime state

2. **Enhanced Authentication Logging**:
   - Added verbose logging of authentication configuration
   - Shows calculated test mode and mock auth values

3. **Debug Utilities**:
   - Created utility functions in `utils/envDebugger.js`
   - Standardized approach for enabling debug information

4. **Test Scripts**:
   - Added `scripts/test-env-variables.js` to verify environment setup
   - Added `scripts/test-intelligence-endpoint.js` to test API with various flags

5. **Debug Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive debugging guide in `ENV_DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md`
   - Documents available tools and troubleshooting processes

## Key Updates to Authentication Logic

1. **Enhanced Error Responses**:
   - Added debug information to 401 unauthorized responses
   - Includes computed configuration values for troubleshooting

2. **Debug Mode Toggle**:
   - Added support for `debug_env: true` flag in request body
   - Added support for `X-Debug-Env: true` header

3. **Improved Environment Logging**:
   - Added detailed logging of all relevant environment variables
   - Shows calculated derived values for test mode and mock auth

## Security Considerations

- Debug endpoints are automatically disabled in production environments
- Debug information requires a special token in production
- Sensitive information is redacted from debug responses

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these changes to test environment
2. Verify environment variable behavior
3. Run test scripts to validate authentication flow
4. Review logs to ensure debug information is available

These updates should provide much better visibility into environment configuration issues while maintaining security in production environments.
