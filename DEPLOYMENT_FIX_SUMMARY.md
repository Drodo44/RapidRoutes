# Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem

The Vercel build was failing due to a missing import in `pages/api/production-verification.js`. The file was trying to import `fetchIntelligencePairs` from `../../lib/intelligenceApi` which didn't exist.

## Solution

1. Created a new file `lib/intelligenceApi.js` that exports the required `fetchIntelligencePairs` function.
2. The function makes a POST request to the intelligence-pairing API with the test_mode flag set to true.
3. Pushed the changes to GitHub which triggered a new Vercel deployment.

## Verification

We created a verification script (`verify-deployment-fix.mjs`) that checks:

1. If the deployment is accessible
2. If test mode is enabled (ALLOW_TEST_MODE environment variable)
3. If the intelligence API works with test_mode
4. If the production verification API works

## Current Status

- ✅ The deployment is now accessible (build is fixed)
- ❌ ALLOW_TEST_MODE is not enabled in the Vercel environment
- ❌ Intelligence API returns 401 Unauthorized when using test_mode
- ❌ Production verification API returns 401 Unauthorized

## Next Steps

1. Set ALLOW_TEST_MODE=true in the Vercel environment variables
2. Set VERIFICATION_API_KEY in the Vercel environment variables
3. Re-run the verification script to confirm all tests pass
4. Verify that the intelligence API works with the test_mode flag

## How to Enable Test Mode

1. Log in to the Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to the RapidRoutes project
3. Go to Settings > Environment Variables
4. Add a new environment variable:
   - Name: ALLOW_TEST_MODE
   - Value: true
5. Add another environment variable:
   - Name: VERIFICATION_API_KEY
   - Value: [secure key for verification]
6. Save the changes and redeploy if needed

After making these changes, run the verification script again to confirm all tests pass:

```bash
node verify-deployment-fix.mjs
```
