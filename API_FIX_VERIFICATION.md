# RapidRoutes API Fix Verification

## Summary of Changes

We have fixed several issues in the RapidRoutes application to ensure the `/api/intelligence-pairing` endpoint works end-to-end in production. The following areas have been addressed:

### 1. Frontend (post-options.js)

- Enhanced token retrieval from Supabase authentication
- Improved logging for token presence and API responses
- Ensured proper Bearer token attachment to API calls

### 2. Backend (intelligence-pairing.js)

- Strengthened token extraction from multiple sources
- Enhanced error handling for authentication failures
- Added support for both camelCase and snake_case field formats
- Improved response normalization for consistent output

### 3. Intelligence System (geographicCrawl.js)

- Fixed typos and improved code consistency
- Enforced minimum of 5 unique KMAs requirement
- Limited search radius to 100 miles maximum
- Added better error messages for diagnostic purposes

### 4. Verification Script (verify-production-api.mjs)

- Added robust support for camelCase and snake_case formats
- Improved token handling and authentication
- Enhanced error reporting for failed API calls

## Verification Steps

After the changes have been deployed to production, follow these steps to verify the fixes:

1. **Set Environment Variables**:

   ```bash
   export TEST_USER_EMAIL=your@email.com
   export TEST_USER_PASSWORD=yourpassword
   ```

2. **Run the Verification Script**:

   ```bash
   node verify-production-api.mjs
   ```

3. **Expected Results**:
   - Authentication successful ✅
   - API call successful with 200 OK response ✅
   - At least 5 unique KMAs in the response ✅
   - Normalized field formats in both camelCase and snake_case ✅

## Manual Testing

You can also verify the changes manually:

1. Navigate to the post-options page in the application
2. Select a lane and click "Generate Pairings"
3. Verify that pairings are generated successfully
4. Check browser console logs for authentication and API response details

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Check that Vercel has completed the deployment
- Verify that the environment variables are set correctly
- Examine the console logs for specific error messages
- Try clearing browser cache and cookies before retesting

The lane generation system should now be fully functional in production, with robust authentication and consistent output formats.
