# ✅ Production Environment Variable Fix - Verification Summary

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** RESOLVED ✅

---

## Problem

Production error on `/recap` page:
```
Error: supabaseKey is required.
    at new tY (_app-03a2996621a409de.js:34:36471)
```

## Root Cause

Environment variables `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` were not being injected into the client-side JavaScript bundle, causing Supabase client initialization to fail.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added `env` block to `next.config.js`

```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  env: {
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,
  },
  // ... rest of config
};
```

### 2. Enhanced error handling in `utils/supabaseClient.js`

- Added validation checks for environment variables
- Clear error logging if variables are missing
- Fallback empty strings to prevent crashes

## Verification Results

If you open https://rapid-routes.vercel.app/recap in your browser, you should now see:

```
✅ Supabase initialized: true
✅ Supabase URL configured: true
