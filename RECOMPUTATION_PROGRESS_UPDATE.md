## 🔥 Why This Matters

Every city being processed right now is going from:
- ❌ 10-50 nearby cities (incomplete) 
- ❌ 1-3 KMAs (missing freight markets)
- ❌ Poor DAT posting coverage

To:
- ✅ 100-500 nearby cities (complete)
- ✅ 5-8 KMAs (full freight market coverage)
- ✅ Optimal DAT posting strategy

This is **enterprise-level freight intelligence** for **every single city** in the database.

## 📝 Next Steps

**When 100% complete (~37 minutes from start):**

1. **Verify Chicago:** Should show 844 cities in 6 KMAs
2. **Verify Dallas:** Should show 200+ cities in 5+ KMAs
3. **Verify NYC:** Should show 400+ cities in 6+ KMAs
4. **Test UI:** Post Options page with complete data
5. **Document:** Final verification report
